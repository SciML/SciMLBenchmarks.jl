# SciML Book

This is a `Franklin.jl` site.
Much of the material originated from Julia Markdown Documents (`*.jmd`).
Each of these documents are `Weave.jl`-ed with a custom template,
and the resulting HTML is inserted into a corresponding markdown file.

The theme is adapted from [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
