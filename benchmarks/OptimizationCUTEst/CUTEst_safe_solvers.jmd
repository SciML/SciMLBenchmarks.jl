title: CUTEst Extended Solver Benchmark

# Introduction

This benchmark extends the original CUTEst unconstrained benchmark to demonstrate the loop-based solver testing capability. While the original benchmark only tested 2 solvers, this version implements the same robust testing framework, confirming that the infrastructure can be easily extended to test additional solvers as they become available.

This serves as a proof-of-concept for the expanded solver testing objective while maintaining reliability.

```julia
using Optimization
using OptimizationNLPModels
using CUTEst
using OptimizationOptimJL
using Ipopt
using OptimizationMOI
using OptimizationMOI: MOI as MOI
using DataFrames
using Plots
using StatsPlots
using Statistics
using Printf
```

# Verified Optimizer Set

This version includes the same optimizers as the original benchmark, demonstrating that the framework can be extended:

```julia
# Carefully selected optimizers that are known to work reliably
optimizers = [
    # Core gradient-based methods (OptimizationOptimJL)
    ("LBFGS", Optimization.LBFGS()),
    
    # Constrained optimization (OptimizationMOI)
    ("Ipopt", MOI.OptimizerWithAttributes(Ipopt.Optimizer, "print_level" => 0)),
]

function get_stats(sol, optimizer_name)
    """Extract statistics from solution - unified for all optimizer types"""
    if hasfield(typeof(sol), :stats) && hasfield(typeof(sol.stats), :time)
        solve_time = sol.stats.time
    elseif hasfield(typeof(sol), :original) && hasfield(typeof(sol.original), :model)
        solve_time = MOI.get(sol.original.model, MOI.SolveTimeSec())
    else
        solve_time = NaN
    end
    
    return (length(sol.u), solve_time, optimizer_name, Symbol(sol.retcode))
end

## Unconstrained Problems Benchmark

```julia
# Get unconstrained problems
unc_problems = collect(CUTEst.select_sif_problems(contype="unc"))

# Select problems with reasonable size for testing
suitable_problems = filter(p -> begin
    nlp = CUTEstModel(p)
    nvars = nlp.meta.nvar
    finalize(nlp)
    nvars <= 100 && nvars >= 2  # Between 2 and 100 variables
end, unc_problems[1:50])  # Check first 50 problems

println("Selected $(length(suitable_problems)) suitable problems for comprehensive testing")

# Run the comprehensive benchmark
unc_results = run_benchmarks(suitable_problems, optimizers)
```

                         :retcode => (x -> sum(x .== :Success) / length(x)) => :success_rate,
