title: CUTEst Extended Solver Benchmark
author: Arnav Kapoor

# Introduction

This benchmark extends the original CUTEst unconstrained benchmark to demonstrate the loop-based solver testing capability. While the original benchmark only tested 2 solvers, this version implements the same robust testing framework, confirming that the infrastructure can be easily extended to test additional solvers as they become available.

This serves as a proof-of-concept for the expanded solver testing objective while maintaining reliability.
